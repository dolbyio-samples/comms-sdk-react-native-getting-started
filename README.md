# Dolby.io Communications SDK for React Native - Getting Started app

This is the sample app from the React Native application used in the [Getting Started](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/getting-started-with-reactnative-sdk) article. 

You can find additional reference documentation here:
- [Reference](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/rn-client-sdk-references-commsapi)

## Using the App

We highly suggest following the getting started above. As a quickstart, ensure you have the following installed:

- `yarn`
- Your environment setup for the target OS of your choice: https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/environment-setup

Then install the node dependencies inside of the cloned repository with
```sh
cd DolbyIoGettingStarted
yarn
```

Once complete, launch the app with the command for your target OS. Please use a **real device** and not an emulator for best results.

```sh
npx react-native run-android
---
npx react-native run-ios
```
